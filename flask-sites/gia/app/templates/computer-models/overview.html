      <p>Computer models are programs written to simulate real world systems based on our understanding of the physical laws that govern them. These laws are expressed as mathematical equations which, given the required inputs, can be solved to produce an approximation of some other state of the system in the form of output variable values.</p>
      <p>
      <p>Here you can learn more about the computational modelling that goes into our understanding of past, present and future sea level rise. This section also discusses the input requirements for  each model. Click below to learn how these models work together to help us predict sea level.</p>

			<h1 class="card-title">Sea Level Model</h1>
			<p class="card-text">In its simplest form a sea level model needs to calculate the water lost or gained from ice sheets, distribute this change accross the ocean and calculate the associated change in ocean height. However, the redistribution of mass causes other important effects to occur including glaical isostatic adjustment.</p>

			<h1 class="card-title">Ice-Sheet Model</h1>
			<p class="card-text">An ice sheet is defined by it's extent and thickness with both of variables being subject to sigificant change with time. There are many approaches to ice-sheet modelling with the most complex usually requring the greatest amount of input information. However, when information is scarse it is still possible to reconstruct ice-sheets based on a number of simplifying assumptions.</p>
